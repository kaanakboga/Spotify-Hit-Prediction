# Spotify Hit Prediction ðŸŽµðŸŽ¯

A machine learning project to predict whether a song will be a hit on Spotify, based on audio features like danceability, energy, and acousticness.

## Features

- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- SMOTE balancing
- Random Forest classification
- Model optimization (GridSearchCV)

## Technologies

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- SMOTE (Imbalanced-learn)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Results

Achieved 93.6% accuracy with base model. Optimized model improved recall for "hit" songs using SMOTE and hyperparameter tuning.
